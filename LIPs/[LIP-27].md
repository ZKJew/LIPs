## Abstract

<!--
  The Lens Algorithm Marketplace enables users to monetize their feeds and allows third parties to sell curated feeds to users. LIP-26 proposes a primitive where users can bring their own algorithms to a client and switch between them. This primitive introduces a new category of marketable assets. Instead of clients extracting value from users with their own algorithms, users can now create and sell access to their own algorithms. The marketplace fosters competition among users, clients, and third-party organizations in curating content for mutual benefit rather than exploiting users.
-->

## Motivation

<!--
  This LIP aims to create a marketplace for User-Owned Algorithm Tokens (UOAs) in order to expand their distribution. In this marketplace, users can purchase or rent UOAs, earn from their own UOAs, or utilize UOAs curated by third parties. By introducing a free-market approach to content curation, users can potentially benefit from algorithms that currently exploit them in today's social media landscape.
-->

## Specification

<!--
  The Lens Algorithm Marketplace aims to support the sale or rental of algorithms while keeping their contents confidential utilizing encryption and zero-knowledge cryptography where necessary. It should enable users, clients, third parties, and AI agents mining data to buy, rent, or sell their User-Owned Algorithms (UOAs) on the blockchain. Transactions should be settled via smart contracts, eliminating the need for intermediaries. Essentially, it should serve as an open marketplace where any entity can engage in various forms of trade and curation. 

-->

## Rationale

<!--
  Simply put, the Lens Algorithm Marketplace aims to commoditize User-Owned Algorithm (UOA) feeds, akin to how blockchains have commoditized cryptocurrencies like BTC and ETH.
