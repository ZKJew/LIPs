## Abstract

 In the discussion of opening Lens there were two persistent issues that this LIP hopes to address. One of the issues is that developers lack the userbase to bootstrap their apps. Another issue is that users get bored due to lackluster engagement/app developement. This creates a situation where both problems must be tackled at the same time, or else efforts to fix them will fail. Lens Quests will gamify the solution by incentizing users to learn how to use Lens and try out developers applications.

## Motivation

@punkess highlighted that there is a large problem with churn on Lens where there are over 100k profiles, but only about 3.5k have been routinely active in the past 3 months. She shed light on the importance of giving tutorials for users to onboard themselves to Lens and stay on Lens. Additionally, Lens Quests could help developers bootstrap apps and test out features. Furthermore, assisting developers in bootstrapping userbases and reducing churn is the main motivation for this subsiquent LIP.

## Specification and Rationale

Lens Quests are a fun way to gamify onboarding users to Lens and helping developers bootstrape their applications ecosystem. Lens Quests would incentize users to complete tasks nessesary for onboarding like enabling the dispatcher in order to complete a quest that rewards the user with "experience points." Similar to a game, these points would be used to level up the users Lenny leading to items and customizations of the NFT. Application developers could also submit Quests to the community and or core team in order to bootstrap their projects and test features. Moreover, the core team could design quests to retain users during growth periods and reduce churn. All in all, Lens Quests are a fun way to gamify and attempt to address problems of bootstraping applications and churn within the ecosystem as the doors to the garden open up.
