## Abstract

<!--
Every User-Owned Algorithm (UOA) will generate specific content for a user based on the specifications outlined in its metadata. This means that the content viewed by the user is determined by what is defined in the UOA's metadata. The Lens Algorithm Marketplace enables the trading of inclusion of posts in a users feed. However, it also introduces an opportunity to commoditize the content within the UOA itself, known as "feedspace". This refers to the ability for users to profit from the inclusion of metadata in their UOAs.

For instance, an emerging creator could benefit by paying for third-party algorithms to incorporate their content into their UOAs for a specified number of posts or a certain duration. This arrangement could mutually benefit both parties involved.
-->

## Motivation

<!--
User-Owned Algorithms (UOAs) have the potential to be a decisive factor distinguishing Web3 platforms from traditional social media. By commoditizing the metadata within UOAs, we can level the playing field for creators who lack the network effects needed to compete in today's algorithm-driven environments. Instead of optimizing content purely to appease algorithms, creators can concentrate on producing high-quality content to foster growth, leveraging the ability to purchase feed space within UOAs. This shift allows for a more equitable opportunity for all creators to thrive based on content quality rather than algorithmic manipulation.
-->

## Specification

<!--
The availability of feed space should be determined by the owner of the User-Owned Algorithm (UOA). For instance, in a scenario involving a third-party-managed UOA system, the third party should have the ability to offer a percentage of a user's feed, specify the number of users it reaches, the frequency of queries, or the duration content remains visible in the user's UOA metadata.
Consider this other example: an advertiser wishes to include ads in 1% of the feed space and offers to pay the user 5 USDC per year. These implementations of feed space enable users to exert greater control and derive benefits from their attention on social media platforms.

-->

## Rationale

<!--
The purpose of this LIP is to enhance users' ownership of their social media experience. User-Owned Algorithms (UOAs) empower users to control the content they see in their feeds. The Lens Algorithm Marketplace facilitates the trading of these UOAs in a competitive market, aiming to generate advantages for users. Additionally, the concept of feed space enables users and creators to gain financial or social benefits through the inclusion of curated content in users' feeds.
