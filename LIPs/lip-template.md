## Abstract

<!--
  LIPs-26, 27, and 28 propose a plethora of new ways a user can retain ownership over their algorithm and feed. They propose a standard of User Owned Algorithms (UOA) that can be created, imported to apps, and exported on-chain by apps. They also recommend a Lens Algorithm Marketplace, which fosters the buying, renting, and selling of algorithms; on top of that, it also creates the transactability of “feed space” or a part of a user’s feed in their UOA’s metadata. To carry these ideas out LIP-29 lays out a framework detailing roles of entities in this ecosystem, which consist of users, agents, apps, and 3rd party algorithm generators.
-->

## Motivation

<!--
  This LIP aims to create a marketplace for User-Owned Algorithm Tokens (UOAs) in order to expand their distribution. In this marketplace, users can purchase or rent UOAs, earn from their own UOAs, or utilize UOAs curated by third parties. By introducing a free-market approach to content curation, users can potentially benefit from algorithms that currently exploit them in today's social media landscape.
-->

## Specification/Rationale

<!--
    The main promise of this LIP and its components is to provide the proper incentives for the cheapest and best algorithms for users, as well as decreasing the switching costs between apps. This is done by the separation of power in the insertion of the metadata to the users’ UOA. In the system, the user provides basic instructions, mostly in the form of feedback to an agent. The agent is paid in some form (ex. Collect fee or time spent on app from apps, or payment from third parties) to fill the user’s feed with desirable content. The agent then brokers feed space in the UOA on the user’s behalf to provide the best content from 3rd parties and maximize revenue for the user. In one scenario, the agent might sell a user’s premium content to 3rd parties. In another, it might hold a bidding contest between two competing 3rd parties. There are a lot of plausible applications of this framework creating a whole economy, as well as more avenues of ownership for users and creators. It allows creators to target likely new followers by allowing agents to purchase feed space precisely. And, it reduces the overall opportunity cost that every web2 user has of being monetized by an entity other than themselves.
-->

## Security Considerations

<!--
  All LIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. For example, include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. LIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. An LIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.
